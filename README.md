Take a seat
=============
In this repo, I have create an API for a system make it easy to user to reserve a seat for a match.
The system has many types of users, each one of them has its own functions, like the following

* Adminstrator
    * Approve new users as an authority.
    * Remove an existing user.

* Managers
    * Create a new match event
    * Edit the details of an existing match.
    * Add a new stadium.
    * View match details
    * View vacant/reserved seats for each match.

* Customers (Fans):
    * Edit their data.
    * View matches details
    * Reserve vacant seat(s) in future matches.
    * Cancel a reservation

* Guest
    * Register a new account.
    * Sign in as an existing account
    * View matches details
